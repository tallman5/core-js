The rest of the code in this repo is for a test site.

## Monaco Editor with Custom Grammers
A very special and huge thanks goes to dannymcgee!
The Monaco utilities in this project reuse his language files.
His languages combined with the VS Code theme makes for the best Klipper file editing.
This package simply web-enables them (among other things).
His project is [dannymcgee's klipper](https://github.com/dannymcgee/vscode-klipper)
