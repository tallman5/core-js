## Monaco Editor with Custom Grammers
ðŸŒŸ Enormous gratitude to dannymcgee!
The Monaco utilities within this project draw from his language files.
When combined with the VS Code theme, they create an exceptional experience for editing Klipper files.
This package takes it a step further by web-enabling these utilities, among other features.
His project is [dannymcgee's klipper](https://github.com/dannymcgee/vscode-klipper)
